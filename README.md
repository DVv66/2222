## Projects in Dry_Bean_Data
- **[Dry Bean Classification ✅]:** The objective of this project is to test the effectiveness of a range of classifier models on the UCI Dry Bean dataset see [details here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset) with machine learning techniques. The dataset is available in the folder Dry_Bean_Classification in the file Dry_Bean_Dataset.csv. There is a second objective to address a scenario where one type of error is more serious than others, i.e. one of the bean types is poisonous. 

## Projects in classifying time series data
- **[Time Series Running Data classification ✅]:** The objective of this assignment is to identify good models for classifying time series data. The data is from an accelerometer sensor and there are samples of fatigued and non-fatigued running. The data has been segmented into strides and the segments (samples) are labeled F (fatigued) and NF (not fatigued). The data for two subjects A and B are available in the files
